Astrana Releases
=========================================================

.. TIP:: To get the latest Astrana release visit `www.astrana.org/releases/latest <https://www.astrana.org/releases/latest>`_

The Astrana Project is a non-profit, community supported, open-source project, 
with no full time or paid maintainers or contributors.

The project maintainers endeavour to create improved releases regularly and 
timeously, but releases can be delayed due to maintainer and/or contributor 
unavailability (usually due to professional and personal commitments). 

The project maintainers aim to address security and privacy related defects 
and flaws as soon as they become aware of them. When there is a critical 
severity issue, a patch release will be made available as soon as an adequate 
solution has been implemented for the issue. 

Patch releases for high severity security and privacy defects may be delayed 
for a short time (e.g. days or weeks) so that multiple patches may be bundled 
together as a single patch release to reduce the number of updates end-users 
will have to manage.

Releases for functional and performance improvements will also be made 
available as soon as possible, but are likely to be made available on a monthly 
or quarterly basis.
