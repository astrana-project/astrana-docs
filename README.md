# Astrana Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the Astrana software applications.

We are using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) to host the documentation and the rendered version can be found [here](https://docs.astrana.org).

Documentation is authored in ReStructuredText (RST) - you can find a primer [here](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html).

You can find more information about Read the Docs and Sphinx under the following links:
